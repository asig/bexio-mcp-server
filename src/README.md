# Bexio MCP Server

MCP server that connects Claude Desktop to [Bexio](https://www.bexio.com/), the Swiss accounting platform. 315 tools for invoices, contacts, projects, time tracking, banking, account balances, and more.

> **Early Release** — Functional and tested, but under active development. [Report issues here.](https://github.com/promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server/issues)

## Install

### Option 1: Download Extension (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `.mcpb` from [Releases](https://github.com/PromptPartner/bexio-mcp-server/releases)
2. In Claude Desktop, go to **Extensions** > **Advanced Settings** > **Install Extension**
3. Select the downloaded `.mcpb` file
4. Enter your Bexio API token when prompted — done!

### Option 2: npm

```bash
npx @promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server
```

Or add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bexio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BEXIO_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Config location:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server
cd bexio-mcp-server/src
npm install && npm run build
BEXIO_API_TOKEN=your-token node dist/index.js
```

### n8n and HTTP Clients

Start in HTTP mode for n8n or other HTTP-based MCP clients, with a bearer token:

```bash
BEXIO_API_TOKEN=your-token BEXIO_HTTP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  npx @promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server --mode http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Clients then send `Authorization: Bearer <BEXIO_HTTP_TOKEN>` on every request (`GET /`,
the health check, stays open).

> **Security:** every tool reads or changes your books. Without `BEXIO_HTTP_TOKEN` the HTTP
> endpoints are unauthenticated: on `0.0.0.0` (the default) anyone who can reach the port
> can use them, and because CORS allows any origin, even a loopback-only server can be
> called by a web page open in your browser. The server warns at startup when no token is
> set. Local file paths (`upload_file` `file_path`, `download_file` `output_path`) are
> refused over HTTP unless `BEXIO_FILE_DIR` names a directory to confine them to.

## Compatibility
